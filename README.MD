## REST API based URL Shortener

- A URL shortener is a tool or service that takes a long URL and creates a shorter version that redirects to the original URL.
- The primary purpose of URL shorteners is to make long URLs more manageable, shareable, and easier to remember.
- They are particularly useful in situations where character count is limited, such as in social media posts or messages.
